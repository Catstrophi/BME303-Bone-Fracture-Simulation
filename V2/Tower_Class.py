"""
Creates a tower class. Takes in window, health, damage, attack range, and position.
There will be two positional variables:
        cell_x/cell_y - this is referring to the grid coordinate system.
                Used to calculate distance between enemy and tower

        pixel_x/pixel_y - this is referring to the pixels. Python doesn't know what the grid is
        since I defined each grid to be x amount of pixels.
                Used to draw new shapes and objects on the window

First creates what a tower is, creates the range, and adds the hp.

Then it defines the attack and take damage function.
    It checks all enemies on the board. If any of them are are within a certain range do x amount of damage to them
    It removes x amount of damage from health and updates the health

Then it creates a function of place tower. I want the tower above and below the shaft but within the knobs of the bone.
    Then I automatically space them evenly
